In the following videos, we will be working with the command line using Unix commands.

These commands are the same ones you would run in a Linux server (most servers on the internet run Linux) and will work fine on a Linux system or Mac.

Some commands are different on Windows though.

For consistency reasons, if you are a Windows user, you can use Git-bash to overcome this. (Git-bash may be already installed on your computer if you are using the latest Windows versions)

And to make things easier, you can use hyper which can run using Git-bash.

You can follow these steps and you will be up and running in no time:

Download & install hyper using this link: https://releases.hyper.is/download/win

Download & install Git using this link: https://git-scm.com/download/win. When selecting components, make sure “Windows explorer integration -> Git Bash Here” is ticked.

Go to: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/droidMakk/f975a21b9d41578b19382ee102efc24d/raw/fc3bbf6423a746e456eee4cbb69d5a49ec7c9c6c/.hyper.js. Click anywhere on the webpage and press Ctrl-A, then Ctrl-C.

Open the hyper terminal and press Ctrl-Comma. This will open your hyper configuration file.

Click anywhere inside the configuration file, then press Ctrl-A, then Ctrl-V. This will paste the content of the webpage above to your file. Press Ctrl-S to save and close the configuration file.

Restart Hyper: Now you will be able to run Unix commands on your Windows machine.
